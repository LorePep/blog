## About

A brief history of my education and experience

**Education**

I got a BSc in Informatic Engineering and a MSc in Robotics and Automation from University of Pisa. After that I got a PhD in Perceptual Robotics from Scoula Superiore Sant'Anna. The main focus of my PhD was human motion reconstruction from cheap sensors applied to robotic teleoperation and robotic embodiement.

In 2015 and later in 2017, I spent some time in LA at USC with Prof. Valero Cuevas applying my nondynamical system knowledge and to study Parkinson's Disease.  

During 2016 I spent a year as a PostDoc at Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, my main focus was traditional Machine Learning and Deep Learning applied to biomedical signals. 

**Startups**

While finishing my PhD I started to work as a Data Analyst at Neuromuscular Dynamics. The startup focuses on dexterity analysis for various medical conditions and sport performance. There I was (and still am) managing the whole analysis software stack (backend, frontend, reporting and the analysis itself).

In 2017 I joined Blue Vision Labs, a London-based startup, developing the next-gen of augmented reality. There I mainly worked with Computer Vision and benchmarking large-scale AR systems. Also, my interest in distributed systems grew bigger, to the point that I switched my role from Research Engineer to Software Engineer. 

After approximately 1 year, Blue Vision Labs got acquired by Lyft and became part of L5, Lyft's self-driving division. Since then, I have been working there as a Software Engineer, and I must admit I'm loving the switch back to Robotics and more "researchy" topics.


## Random Things I do

This is a list of some other random things and projects:

* **Blogging**: As you may have notices I manage this blog, plus I also write on [Medium](https://medium.com/@l.peppoloni), where I also write for publications such as [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/). I don't cross-post everything so feel free to have a look also at the articles on Medium.

* **Kaggle**: as a hobby I sometimes take part to Kaggle competitions (mainly Computer Vision oriented), and I am currently "Competition Expert".

* **Music**: I am a decent drummer (I did it for a living while finishing my studies) and a barely acceptable guitar player.
